# PiTFTDomoPanel
Raspberry PI + PiTFT based home automation web control panel with screen activated by PIR movement detector

This project was started so that I am able to control some basic functions of my home automation system at home. It uses a RaspberryPi with a 2.8" capacitive touch PiTFT display from Adafruit and a small PIR movement detection module.

The idea is to activate the screen only when movement is detected to avoid useless screen usage and wear when the panel is not in use. The device simply displays a web page from the home automation system.

This projects consists of many parts:
* A 3D box model to house everything
* The list of hardware needed to create the project
* The code that manages the PIR movement detector
* Setup instructions to enable the PiTFT display and setup X to display a web page in kiosk mode
